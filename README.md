# Identifying-Radicalisation-amongst-youth-through-Youtube-Comments
A social network analysis of political issues by analysing video comments on YouTube.  
•	Identification of Radicalization influence in the YouTube comments.  
•	Finding the same profile/users/comments in different video posted on YouTube.  

There are various techniques which can be used to detect radicalization or radicalization influence in the YouTube contents. The Pre-processing of raw data in the form of comments by scraping it from Youtube has been done. Further on after scraping the data,  it is refined to obtain a simplified dataset including dealing with Multilingual text, special characters etc. and making a vast dataset of comments and hence, training the model on it. Then, testing the model for various algorithms to check which one gives the most accurate prediction and hence detecting radicalisation.
